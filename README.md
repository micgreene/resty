Codefellows 401 JavaScript

## Overview

- React App: Component Based UI

- **Business Requirements**

- Our application will be an API testing tool that can be run in any browser, allowing a user to easily interact with APIs in a familiar interface.

- The core requirements and functionality are as follows:

- Simple, intuitive user interface
  - A form where a user:
    - Enters a REST API Endpoint (URI)
    - Selects the REST Method to use (get, post, put, delete)
    - For put and post, allow the user to enter JSON to be used as the body for the request
    - A button to initiate the request
  
  - An output section which:
    - Displays a spinner to indicate a request is in process

  - Once a request is complete:
    - Hide the spinner
    - Display a well formatted view of the API response in 2 sections
      - Headers
      - Body

  - A history section which:
    - Shows a list of all unique, successful requests
    - Allows a user to click or select one to re-populate the form so they can repeat the request

- **Technical Requirements**
  - The application will be created with the following overall architecture and methodologies:
    - React
    - ES6 Classes
    - Shared Component State
    - Local Storage for storing request history
    - Superagent or Axios for performing API Requests
    - SASS for styling
    - Global Theme
    - Component specific CSS where possible
    - Test Driven Development, using Jest
    - Tests will be runnable locally
    - Deployment to GitHub Pages using an Action

- **Development Process, Milestones**
- Phase 1: Application Setup
  - Basic React Application
  - Scaffolding
  - Basic State
  - Rendering

- Phase 2: Testing and Deployment
  - Testing of React components and applications
  - Uses best practices for testing Behaviors and Acceptance Criteria
  - Integrates with an online CI framework
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, and/or AWS

- Phase 3: State and Props
  - Create multiple components to handle each aspect of the Application
  - Sharing state and behaviors between components
  - Basic layout and styling

- Phase 4: Fit and Finish
  - Incorporate the spinner, using conditional rendering
  - App is Fully Tested
  - App is Fully Documented
  - RESTy is Deployed and publicly available
